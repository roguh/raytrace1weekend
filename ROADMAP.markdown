# Planned expansions

- HSV or other more human color system to allow for cleaner color effects
    - CIE L*u*v uniform color space (1976)
    - also Brewer's color sets
    - color manipulation (opposite, triads, brighter, darker, etc); good random color
    - easy color picker through CLI or GUI
- More of my creative input, more figures, more scenes, etc
- Add animation! Motion and line are my preferred artistic mediums, nothing in life is devoid of motion.
    - Move the camera
    - Generate many frames
    - Stitch into a GIF or MP4 file.
- Render video directly?
    - Leverage JavaScript? Leverage existing? Write from scratch in C?
- Render JPG/PNG directly?
    - Write my own PNG emitter? Write my own compression code too?
