# Planned expansions

- More of my creative input, more figures, more scenes, etc
- Add animation! Motion and line are my preferred artistic mediums, nothing in life is devoid of motion.
    - Move the camera
    - Generate many frames
    - Stitch into a GIF or MP4 file.
- Render video directly?
    - Leverage JavaScript? Leverage existing? Write from scratch in C?
- Render JPG/PNG directly?
    - Write my own PNG emitter? Write my own compression code too?
